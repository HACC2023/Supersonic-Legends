<p><b>menehune</b> is an assistant that provides students, employees, and faculty information about the University of Hawaii <u>before</u> and <u>as</u> you need it.</p>
<p>This prototype version of this application specializes in UH Information Technology Services support and UH Information Security Policies.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p><b>menehune</b> is an extension (Google Chrome) to your web browser that constantly monitors what you are viewing.  <b>menehune</b> is tuned to look for specific keywords in the pages called "special text".  The "special text" is associated with a specially crafted Google AI prompt relevant to "hawaii.edu" webpage the user is viewing.  That prompt is automatically sent to the Google AI service (Seach and Conversation).  Google AI summarizes a response from the database of UH ITS AskUS webpages and UH information security policies.  The AI-generated summary response and citations to relevant documents are returned and displayed in the web browser extension.</p>
